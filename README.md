### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Portuguese master's student of Engineering Physics - information physics specialization - at the University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.



I am also a research student at LIP Minho, where I am doing my master's thesis on quantum computing applications to quantum chromodynamics.


ðŸ”­ I have experience with machine learning, quantum machine learning, quantum computing, quantum algorithms, and quantum information. I am curious about the theoretical foundations of particle physics, solid state physics, and probably anything else that could help to learn how the world is made and works. I think that outreach activities are of enormous importance in society, and so I like to get involved in them.


âœ¨ I love to learn new things, special when related to _physics_, _machine learning_, _quantum computing_, _quantum information_, _data analysis_ and ... _cooking_. âœ¨


ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always looking for good books, good articles, or simply a good talk.
