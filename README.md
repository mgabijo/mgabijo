### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Portuguese master's student of Engineering Physics - information physics specialization - at the University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.//

I am also a research student at LIP Minho, where I am doing my master's thesis on quantum computing applications to quantum chromodynamics.

âœ¨ I love to learn new things, special when related to _physics_, _machine learning_, _quantum computing_, _quantum information_ and ... _cooking_. âœ¨
